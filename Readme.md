## Greenbone Community Containers
The Greenbone community has worked to release [Greenbone Community Containers](https://greenbone.github.io/docs/latest/22.4/container/index.html). v22.4 made several major changes including the introduction of the MQTT broker and Notus scanner. That project doesn't necessarily work the same way as this and it doesn't support remote scanners, but we strongly recommend using the most recent version of GVM instead of this project.

## Thank You
Thank you contributors and Greenbone community. Your dedication, feedback, and contributions have been invaluable.
